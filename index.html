<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of healthy weight.
It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. 

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and a height in feet and inches and displays the users BMI value. 

To convert the users weight in pounds to their weight in kilograms you will need to use the fact that there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram. 
</p>

<!-- -Equation for BMI : (weight in kg)/((height in meters)^2)

- equation to convert pounds to kg : (pounds/2.2) = kg

- equation to convert inches to meters : (inches*0.0254) = meters -->


<script>
	var weight = prompt("In pounds, how much do you weigh?");
	weight = parseFloat(weight);
	weight = (weight / 2.2);

	// output is weight in kg

	var height = prompt("In inches, how tall are you? (For reference: 1 foot = 12 inches; 5 feet = 60 inches");
		height = parseFloat(height);
		height = (height * 0.0254);

	// output is height in meters*

	var bmi = (weight/(height * height));

	console.log("your BMI is " + bmi);

</script> 


2.
The temperature T in degrees Celsius (°C) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) minus 32, times 5/9.

<!--> Tc = (Tf-32) * (1.8)-->

Write a program which asks the user the temperature in celsius and displays it in Fahrenheit.

<script>
	
	var tempC = prompt("What is the temperature in celsius?");
		tempC = parseFloat(tempC);

	var tempF = ((tempC * 1.8) + 32);

	console.log("it is " + tempF +" degrees Fahrenheit");

</script>

<p>3.
Create a program which prompts the user to enter five test scores. Then, output the average of the five test scores.</p>

<script>
	
var score1 = prompt("Enter one test score");
	score1 = parseFloat(score1);

var score2 = prompt("Enter another test score");
	score2 = parseFloat(score2);

var score3 = prompt("Enter another test score");
	score3 = parseFloat(score3);

var score4 = prompt("Enter another test score");
	score4 = parseFloat(score4);

var score5 = prompt("Enter one last test score");
	score5 = parseFloat(score5);

var average = ((score1 + score2 + score3 + score4 + score5)/5);

console.log("Your test average is " + average);

</script>
